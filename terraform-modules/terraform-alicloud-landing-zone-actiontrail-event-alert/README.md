## Requirements

* You need to create trails for ActionTrail using SLS. For Landing Zone environment, we recommended using multi-account trail as described in [doc](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/actiontrail/user-guide/create-a-multi-account-trail).
* You can use Terraform module [terraform-alicloud-landing-zone-log-archive](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/alibabacloud-automation/landing-zone-log-archive/alicloud/latest) to create a multi-account trail.
* For this module, please see Terraform and provider requirements from [versions.tf](versions.tf).

## Docs

### Providers

You need to pass two providers explicitly to module.

* `alicloud`: This provider used to create alert of log service. The region configured for this provider should be the same as the SLS project for ActionTrail trail.
* `alicloud.log_resource_record`ï¼šThis provider used to create user and user group of log service. The region configured for this provider must be cn-heyuan.

### Variables

* `project_name`: the SLS project for ActionTrail trail.
* `log_store`: the log store used for store ActionTrail events in the SLS project specified above.
* `users`: the users whom the alert notifications are sent.
  * `id`: the ID of the user. The ID must be unique in an Alibaba Cloud account. The ID must be 5 to 60 characters in length, and can contain digits, letters, underscores (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.). It must start with a letter.
